FileOutputStream:
This class extends OutputStream and allows you to write binary data to a file.
constructors:
FileOutputStream(String filepath) throws IOException
FileOutputStream(String filepath, boolean append) throws IOException
FileOutputStream(File fileObj) throws IOException
where filepath is the full path name of a file and fileObj is a file object that describes a file. If append is true, characters are appended to the end of the file.

FilterOutputStream: This class extends OutputStream. It is used to filter output.
Constructor:
FilterOutputStream(OutputStream os)

BufferedOutputSteam : This class extends FilterOutputSteam and buffers output to a byte stream. Its constructor is-

BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream os)
BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream os, int bufSize)


DataOutputStream: This class extends FilterOutputStream and implements DataOutput. It allows you to write the simple Java types to a byte output stream. The constructor is-
DataOutputStream(OutputStream os)

PrintStream:  This class extends FilterOutputStream and provides all of the formatting capabilities from System.out
Constructors:
PrintStream(OutputStream outputStream)
PrintStream(OutputStream outputStream, boolean flushOnNewline)

FileInputStream: This class extends InputStream and allows you to read binary data from a file. The constructors are-
FileInputStream(String filepath)throws FileNotFoundException
FileInputStream(File fileObj) throws FileNotFoundException
where filepath is the full path name of a file and fileObj is a file object.
