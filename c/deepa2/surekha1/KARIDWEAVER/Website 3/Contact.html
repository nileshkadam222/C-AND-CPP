I love receiving your emails and do my best to read them all,</b> but unfortunately I am generally not able to respond to personal emails. As a busy wife, mom and homemaker, whose priority is serving my family, the amount of emails that I receive simply makes it prohibitive for me to attempt to answer them. Thank you for understanding that I need to keep my family first!
<br /><br />
However, your emails are a wonderful encouragement to me! They help me to understand who you are and what is important to you, and I do try to use the questions and concerns that are brought to my attention as blog inspiration or share them as reader questions on our Facebook page (if we use your question for this purpose, we'll try to let you know and we'll keep it anonymous as well). So please, keep them coming!
<br /><br />

Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you!
