<b>Recipes and Ideas for What to Eat on the GAPS Introduction Diet.
</b>
</center>
<br /><br />
We've just begun our 3rd week on the GAPS diet, and all is well.
<br /><br />
We are beginning to see some very positive results in our family, including less eczema for the baby and toddler, a decrease in heartburn for my husband, and some behavioral improvements with our toddler as well. We've all experienced some toxin die-off, and our cravings for sweet and carbs has been lessening.
<br /><br />
The hardest part of any helpful but restrictive special diet like GAPS is knowing what you can make, when all of your regular foods and meals go out the window. I have experienced this challenge (and am still experiencing it) almost daily, but thankfully there are many great resources out there and ways to make doing this diet as painless as possible.

Help for the Intro Diet
</b>
</center>
<br /><br />
The very beginning of the Intro Diet was the toughest part for us. My kids began balking at the idea of another soup by the end of day 2. So what to do?
<br /><br />
Keep your soups as varied and interesting as possible. This can be done even with a limited array of ingredients to choose from. Really mix and match your veggie and meat choices up. Lots of sea salt helps with flavor. See this tutorial on making soups from scratch without a recipe for more ideas.
<br /><br />
Let kids drink their soups, either with a straw or in a mug.
Add in a few simple, digestible foods if that will help you get through the beginning stages if you're really struggling. Personally, we chose to add in free-range eggs and peeled, cooked, organic apples. Eggs were usually boiled or scrambled. The apples I cut into thin slices and "fried" them in a pan with a bit of water for steam until they were soft and cooked through, and gave them a small sprinkle of cinnamon for added appeal. Applesauce was good as well.
If you need to start adding in other foods, just stay diligent with the bone broth. We still try to drink some broth in a mug with almost every meal, whether we have soup or not.
