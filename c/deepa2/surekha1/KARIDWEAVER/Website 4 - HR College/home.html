"The empires of the future will be the empires of the mind."
- Sir Winston Churchill
<br />
<br />
As globalization gathers further momentum, there are some discernable trends: highly educated and motivated young generation, a younger and increasingly wealthier east, a gradual shift of capital to Asian markets, a rising and rapidly globalizing workforce and the emergence of huge numbers of new consumers in markets like India and China. India has a demographic dividend of over 500 million youngsters. The college seizes this opportunity through modernized teaching and learning to convert this dividend into advantage.
<br />
<br />
Professionalization of higher education is a daily practice at H R College and it has been our constant endeavour to prepare future managers for global challenges.

Numerous knowledge-enhancement programs in the summer have been initiated in academic and non-academic areas.
