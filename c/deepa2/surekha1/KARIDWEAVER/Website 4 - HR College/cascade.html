Enriching students' potential, shaping theirpersonality, nurturing their talents and giving them the platform they deserve is what the CASCADE CLUB (co-curricular club) is all about. Cascade club is a perfect combination of HARDWORK, EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT and a lot of FUN which leads to SUCCESS in every event undertaken. It believes in its slogan "EXCEL IN ACADEMICS, EXCEL IN ACTIVITIES". The CASCADE core team had decided not to refuse membership to anyone as everyone has some unique talent and we help to bring it out. The following events were conducted during the academic year 2009-10.
<br /><br />

The Junior College members were in action much before the academic year had begun, they were helping the students' council with admission work. The admission process can be grilling for any new comer and the students helped the new entrants to make the transition as easy as possible.
